Paul Macklin is a mathematician, Associate Professor of Intelligent Systems Engineering, and Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education at the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering at Indiana University. His lab develops open source multiscale simulation frameworks for 3D multicellular systems biology, including [PhysiCell](http://physicell.org), an agent-based modeling framework that won the [2019 PLoS Computational Biology Research Prize for Public Impact](https://blogs.plos.org/biologue/2019/05/31/announcing-the-winners-of-the-2019-plos-computational-biology-research-prize/). He works with a network of collaborators to ease the use and increase the utility of agent-based simulations, including high-throughput investigations on HPC, cloud-hosted interactive simulators (e.g., pc4biorobots), integrated cell signaling, and AI-driven model exploration. Macklin's lab applies these technologies to cancer, immunology, infectious diseases, and related areas. He also works to integrate simulation modeling, next-generation tissue cultures, and artificial intelligence to create digital twins for the future of personalized predictive cancer medicine. 

When Paul isn't working, his hobby is astrophotography. You can find some of his work (and prints) at [his Darkrooom site](https://mathcancer.darkroom.com).
